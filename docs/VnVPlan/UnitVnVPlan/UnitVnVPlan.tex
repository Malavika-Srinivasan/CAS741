This document explains the unit verification and validation plan to improve the 
quality of \famname{}. It is organized into different sections which gives a 
detailed description of the \famname{} in terms of its goals, objectives, 
essential qualities and test cases to verify each module listed in the MG. 



\section{General Information}

This section explains the summary of what is being tested in this document, the 
objectives of this document and references for this document. 


\subsection{Purpose}

This document will summarize the plan for verification and validation of
of the modules of \famname{} in compliance with their functions mentioned in 
the MIS document found at 
\url{https://github.com/Malavika-Srinivasan/CAS741/tree/master/docs/Design/MIS/MIS.pdf}

The goal statement as found in the CA document is presented below.\\
\noindent ``Given the set of data points, the choice of software from 
\famname{} and the variabilities of the software the \famname{} should:

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Compute the parameters of the curve which is the best possible fit 
	through the set of data points.	''
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Scope}

Some of the modules such as sequence services and plot module are not 
implemented by \famname{} but are a part of it. The services offered by these 
modules are implemented by python and testing them are out of scope for this 
project.

\section{Plan}

This section represents the planning phase for unit verification and validation 
plan in terms of people, tasks and tools involved in this process.
	
\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The verification and validation team for \famname{} includes the following 
people.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Malavika Srinivasan (Primary tester)
	\item Dr.Spencer Smith (Verification of this document)
	\item Hanane Zlitni (Verification of this document)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

In this project, we will be using Pytest to verify the modules of \famname{}. 
It is a testing framework available in python. The results of the test 
including the code coverage metrics will be presented in the test report. We 
will be using cov package which gives the code coverage metrics.



\subsection{Non-Testing Based Verification}

NA

\section{Unit Test Description}

The test cases presented here will verify the access programs of the modules 
listed in MIS. Usually, each access method will have a test case associated 
with it. If not, the reason for why the method does not have an associated test 
case is explained.
The MIS can be found at 
\url{https://github.com/Malavika-Srinivasan/CAS741/tree/master/docs/Design/
	MIS/MIS.pdf}




\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

NA

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}
\ms{I have parallel testing, which makes sense as a system test. But not for 
unit test.}
\subsubsection {Input Module}

In this section , we will present the test cases for each access method. Since 
all the access methods are tested, the entire module will be tested. The test 
cases for this module are selected based on the constraints for the input data. 
The typical constraints on the input data for \famname{} is given by the data 
type, length. Some of the inputs such as the degree of the polynomial have 
mathematical restrictions of being a natural number. The test cases listed 
below are designed to check whether the input data to \famname{} violates these 
constraints.  


\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{T1: Test case for verify input - One data point}}\\
Please refer to test case T1 in section \ref{InputTesting} in System 
verification and validation plan.
\begin{comment}
Type:  Automatic

Initial State: NA

Input: t=[1] , y=[2] (length 1)

Output: Error message (``Please enter at least \wss{proof read}\ms{Corrected} 2 
points'')

How test will be performed: Pytest
\end{comment}					

Test Case Derivation: We need at least two points to draw a straight line which 
is the lowest order polynomial. Only one data point does not need a curve or 
numbers to represent itself. The coordinates would be sufficient. Hence, 
\famname{} should throw an exception.

How test will be performed: Pytest
					
\item{\textbf{T2: Test case for verify input - Length mismatch}}

Type: Automatic
					
Initial State: NA 
					
Input: t=[1,2,3] , y=[2,4] (length mismatch)
					
Output: Exception message (``t and y array must have same length.'')

Test Case Derivation: Basic mathematics rule for curve fitting \ms{Not sure 
what to write here?}

How test will be performed: Pytest


\item{\textbf{T3: Test case for verify input - Type error}}\\
Please refer T2 in section \ref{InputTesting} in System verification and 
validation plan.
					

Test Case Derivation: It is necessary that the input arrays contains only 
numbers.

How test will be performed: Pytest


\item{\textbf{T4: Test case for verify degree - value error}}

Type: Automatic

Initial State: NA 

Input: deg = 1.5 

Output: Exception message (``Degree cannot be a real number'')

Test Case Derivation: Basic mathematics rule for curve fitting \ms{Not sure 
	what to write here too?}

How test will be performed: Pytest

\subsubsection{Interpolation module}

In this section, we will represent the test cases for each access program

a given $t$ value.

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
