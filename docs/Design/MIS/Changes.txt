Summary of Changes to MIS

PiecewiseADT Module

- Vincent recommended looking at moving x_1^{init} and x_2^{init} from the interface to the constructor to be inside the constructor, but in the end, I left the interface as it is.  My reasoning is that we might not be able to automatically find the breakpoints for every input.  If we cannot find them, we might need to ask the user to find the points.  We don't want the constructor itself dealing with the user interface.  Therefore, estimates for the breakpoints are provided as parameters that could come from anywhere.  A module (Identify Points) will be added to provide an analysis to identify the best guess for the breakpoints.

TData module

- name changed from Temperature
- added exported constants for calculating finite differences, but they might make more sense as state variables that can be changed for different experimental data
- moved job of reading file to another module (called Load)
- added additional methods so it will be easier to explore the data
- initial thoughts on how to determine T when the data at different sensors are in different stages of the piecewise interpolation
- the liquidus and solidus points have also been added to this module.  These temperature and time values are associated with a particular thermocouple, so when the piecewise curve is added for a curve, the liquidus and solidus values are added at the same time


Load Module

- Ignores the initial transient data
- covert to time values to actual time so that we don't have to worry about conversion to time
- will use IdentifyPts module


Identify Points Module

- rather than have a separate module to store the liquidus and solidus times and temperatures, this information fits well with the state variables in the TData module
- this module does not have state - it has functions
- given a sequence of data it returns information on the breakpoints, liquidus points and solidus points
- the specification for this module is not complete - we need to do some investigation


Sequence Services Module

A few tests are necessary for the sequential data variables.  They are put together in this module.
