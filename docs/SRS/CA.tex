\section{Introduction}

Scientific Computation (SC) is the collection of tools, techniques, and theories that are required to solve problems in the field of science and engineering using computer-based mathematical models. The source data for scientific computation problems are often large sets of data from experiments conducted in a laboratory setup. This large set of data (such as time and temperature) is usually complex to analyze and require segmenting and curve-fitting.

Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points possibly subject to constraints~\cite{CurvefitWiki}.

		}
		\caption{\label{Fig_CurveFitEg} Typical example of a curve fitting process}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

A fit for the data can be obtained by different methods like interpolation, data smoothing and regression.

\subsection{Interpolation}
Interpolation is a process of fitting a function to given data so that the function has some values as the given data.

\subsection{Smoothing}
Smoothing is a process of creating an approximating function that attempts to capture important patterns in the data, while leaving out noise or other rapid phenomena.

\subsection{Regression}
Regression analysis is the process of finding the best fit parameters for a regression model for a given set of data points and thus obtain a curve through a set of data points. \\

\ms{Points to be noted}\\
\ms{***********************************************************************}
\ms{Interpolation means fitting some function to given data so that the function has some values as the given data.}\\
The Simplest 1d interpolation is given by:\\
for a given data ($t_{i},y_{i}$), where $i = 1,2,3...m$,\\
f is an interpolating function such that, \\
\begin{equation*}
f(t_{i}) = y_i \text{where i} = 1,2...m
\end{equation*}

Some of the variabilities includes:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item What form should the function have?
	\item How should the function behave between data points?
	\item Should the function inherit properties of the data such as monotonicity, convexity or periodicity?
	\item Are we interested in the values of the parameters that define the interpolating function, or simply in evaluating the function at various points for plotting or other purposes?
	\item If the function and data are plotted, should the results be visually pleasing?  
\end{itemize}

\section{Selection of function}
The selection of function for interpolation depends on the following factors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How easy is the interpolant or the function is to work with. Working means determining the parameters of the interpolant from the data, evaluating the interpolant at a given point, differentiating or integrating the interpolant.
	\item How well the properties of the interpolant match the properties of the data to be fit(smoothness, monotonicity, convexity, periodicity etc)
\end{itemize}

Some of the familiar functions commonly used for interpolation are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Polynomials
	\item Piecewise Polynomials
	\item Trignometric functions
	\item Exponential functions
	\item Rational functions
\end{itemize}
\ms{Questions: Ask Dr.Smith if we need to have all these five variabilities for fitting data or its enough if we have piecewise and polynomial}

To find an interpolating function for a set of data points, it is important to make sure that the interpolant exists. This comes down to the discussion of matching the number of parameters in the interpolant to number of data points to be fit.If there are too few parameters, then the interpolant does not exist. If there are too many points, then the interpolant is not unique. \\

For a gien set of data points $(t_i,y_i)$, where i $= 1,2 3...m$, an interpolant is chosen from a suitable set of basis functions $\Phi(t), \Phi_1(t), ... \Phi_n(t)$. Therefore, the interpolating function f can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis functions.


\begin{equation*}
f(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j \Phi_j (t) 
\end{equation*}
where $x_j$ are the parameters to be found. But inorder for f to be interpolating the data points $(t_i,y_i)$, 

\begin{equation*}
f(t_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j \Phi_j (t) = y_i
\end{equation*}
where i $= 1,2,3...m$
This can be expressed as a liner system of equations 

\begin{equation*}
Ax = y
\end{equation*}
where A is the basis matrix whose m X n entries are given by,

\begin{equation*}
a_{ij} = \Phi_j(t_i) 
\end{equation*} 
where $a_{ij}$ is the value of $j^{th}$ basis function at $i^{th}$ data point.

\textcolor{violet}{
\subsection{For my understanding}
\ms{Important points to be noted here}}\\
\textcolor{violet}{
\begin{itemize}
	\item m data points $(t_i,y_i)$ where $ i = 1.... m$
	\item n basis function $\Phi_1(t) , \Phi_2(t), \Phi_3(t)... \Phi_n(t)$
	\item f is the interpolating function
	\item f is the linear combination of basis function as shown below
	\item 
	\begin{equation*}
	f(t_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j \Phi_j (t) = y_i
	\end{equation*}
	Where i $= 1, 2 ..m$. Here they consider m because there are m data points
	\item $x_j$ is the parameters of the fit to be found
	\item To find $x_j$, we use matrix solving method because the above form is a system of linear equations.
	 \begin{equation*}
	Ax = y
	\end{equation*}
	Where A is the basis matrix whose entries are given by $a_{ij}$ 
	\item $a_{ij}$ is given by the following equation
	\begin{equation*}
	a_{ij} = \Phi_j (ti)
	\end{equation*}
\end{itemize} 
}

\subsection{Polynomial interpolation}

Polynomial function has different types of basis functions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Monomial
	\item Lagrange
	\item Newton
	\item Orthogonal
	\item Interpolating continuous functions
\end{itemize}
\ms{I have worked out only monomial, lagrange and newton}
\ms{Need to ask if Orthogonal and continous function can be left out}
\subsubsection{Monomial basis}
To interpolate n data points $(t_i,y_i)$, we choose $k = n-1$ as the maximum degree of the polynomial. We define $P_{n-1}$ as the set of polynomials of degree at most n-1 and is composed on first n monomials $\Phi_j$.
\ms{Note: n data points, n basis function, max degree of polynomial = n-1}
\begin{equation*}
\Phi_j (t) = t^{j-1} 
\end{equation*}
where j $= {1,2,...n}$\\
We can construct the polynomial from this which will have the form,\\
\begin{equation*}
P_{n-1}(t) = x_1 + x_2 t + x_3 t^2 + x_4 t^3 + ... x_n t^{n-1} 
\end{equation*}
The matrix form is given by,
\ms{To understand this, see in class notes. Example problem solved} 
\begin{equation*}
Ax = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & t_{1} & t_{1} ^2 & \dots & t_{1} ^{n-1} \\
1 & t_{2} & t_{2} ^2 & \dots & t_{2} ^{n-1} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
1 & t_{n} & t_{n} ^2 & \dots & t_{n} ^{n-1} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1  \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n \\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1  \\
y_2 \\
\vdots \\
y_n \\
\end{bmatrix} = y
\end{equation*} 
\ms{Note: A matrix whose columns are successive powers of some independent variable t is called Vandermonde matrix}
\ms{Assumption: The vandermonde matrix should be non singular provided $t_i$ are all distint, hence the interpolant exists.}
\ms{Cost of computing interpolant is high}

\subsubsection{Lagrange Interpolation}

For a given set of data points $(t_i,y_i)$, $i = 1,2,$ \dots n, the Lagrange polynomial of degree n-1, $P_{n-1}$ is given by,
\begin{equation*}
P_{n-1} (t) = y_1 l_1 (t) + y_2 l_2(t) + \dots y_n l_n (t).
\end{equation*}

where the basis functions(also called fundamental polynomials) for the $l_j$ is given by,
\begin{equation*}
l_j (t) =  \frac{ \Pi _{k=1, k\neq j} ^n (t - t_k)} {\Pi _{k=1,k \neq j} ^ n (t_j - t_k)} = \frac{(t - t_1)}{(t_j - t_1)}...\frac{(t - t_{j-1})}{(t_j - t_{j-1})}\frac{(t - t_{j+1})}{(t_j - t_{j+1})}... \frac{(t - t_n)}{(t_j - t_n)}
\end{equation*}
where j =$ 1,2,... n$\\
The matrix form, 
\begin{equation*}
Ax = y
\end{equation*}
A is the Identity matrix I.
\ms{Expensive to evaluate and more difficult to differentiate and integrate}
\ms{n data points, n basis function, n-1 is the maximum degree of polynomials. Refer to notes for example problem.}
\subsubsection{Newton Interpolation}

For a given set of data points $(t_i,y_i)$, $i = 1,2,$ \dots n, the newton basis function for $P_{n-1}$ is given by,
\ms{n data points, n basis points}
\begin{equation*}
\pi(t) = \Pi_{k=1}^{j-1} (t - t_k) 
\end{equation*}
where j = 1,2,....n\\
When the limits make it vacuous, the product is taken to be 1\\
Also, $\pi_j (t) = 0$ for i<j.
The polynomial $P_{n-1}$ is given by,

\begin{equation*}
P_{n-1} (t) = x_1 + x_2(t-t_1) + x_3(t-t_1)(t-t_2) + ... x_n(t-t_1)(t-t_2)...(t-t_{n-1})
\end{equation*}

The matrix form of basis in $Ax = y$ is lower triangular as $\pi_j (t) = 0$ for i<j with its entries defined by $a_{ij} = \pi_j (t_i)$

\subsection{Piecewise Polynomial Interpolation}
Even though choosing an appropriate basis function and intetpolation points mitigate the difficulties associated with interpolation by a polynomial of higher degree, fitting a single polynomial to a large number of data points will still yield unsatisfactory oscillating behaviour in the interpolant. 
\ms{I think this has reference to my thesis, because we chose Piecewise polynomials for data fitting. I need to add this to thesis as a place holder}
Piecewise polynomial provides an alternative to the difficulties associated with higher order polynomial interpolation. The main advantage is that a large number of data ppints can be fit with a low degree poynomials.

In piecewise polynomial interpolation of a given set of points $(t_i,y_i)$, i $=1,2,...n$, with $t_1 < t_2 < t_3 ...t_n$, a different polynomial is used in each subinterval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$.The points at which the interpolant changes from one polynomial to another is called breakpoints or knots or control points.

\subsubsection{Hermite Cubic interpolation}
Hermite interpolation matches an unknown function both in observed value, and the observed value of its first m derivatives. This means that n(m + 1) values must be known, rather than just the first n values required for Newton interpolation.

Data to be known is given by, \\

\\
The resulting polynomial may have degree at most $n(m + 1)-1$.

In a simple case, using a divided difference to calculate hermite polynomial f, the first step is to copy each point m times.For a simple case $m = 1$ for all points, which means for the given n+1 data points, all the points have m derivatives (here m = 1).\\ 

This means data is of the form,

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
%\begin{table}[ht]
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} 
	\toprule		
	\midrule 
	$(x_0,y_0)$,& $(x_1,y_1)$, & $(x_2,y_2)$, \dots, & $x_{n}, y_{n}$\\
	$(x_0,y_0 ^{'})$,& $(x_1,y_1 ^{'})$, & $(x_2,y_2 ^{'})$, \dots, & $x_{n}, y_{n} ^{'}$\\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}\\
 Note:\\
 $y_0, y_1, y_2$\dots$y_n = f(x_0), f(x_1), f(x_2)$\dots$f(x_n)$\\
 $y_0 ^{'}, y_1 ^{'}, y_2 ^{'}$\dots$y_n ^{'} = f ^{'}(x_0), f ^{'}(x_1), f ^{'}(x_2)$\dots$f ^{'}(x_n)$\\
~\newline
To find:\\
f which is an interpolating polynomial\\
~\newline
Steps to find:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a new data set $z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3$\dots$z_{2n+1}$ such that 
	\begin{equation*}
	z_{2i} = z_{2i+1} = x_i
	\end{equation*}\\
	Which means at i = 0, $z_0 = z_1 = x_0$
	Here we have only $z_0,z_1$ bacause we assumed m = 1, so each element $xi$ repeats in z data set 2 times.\\
	For a general case, where we have k derivatives for each point, the data set $z_0,z_1,z_2,z_N$ will contain k identical copies of $x_i$.\\
	\item Create a divided difference table for the data set $z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3$\dots$z_{2n+1}$. For the general case, $z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3$\dots$z_{N}$\\
	However, When creating the table, divided differences of $j = 2,3,$\dots k 
	identical values will be calculated as,
	$\frac{f^{(j)}(x_i)}{x!}$
	
	\item Then we generate the polynomial by taking the coefficients from the diagonal of the divided difference table, and multiplying the kth coefficient by $\Pi_{i=0} ^{k-1}(x-z_i)$.
	
\end{itemize} 
 
\subsubsection{Cubic spline interpolation}
\ms{This notes is in bookmark named NOTES FOR CUBIC SPLINE}\\
A spline is a piecewise polynomial of degree k that is continuously differentiable $k-1$ times. For a cubic spline, $k = 3$ so it is continuously differentiable $2$ times. \\

Let there be a set of points,\\
\\
K $= {x_0,x_1...,x_m}$ where 

\begin{equation*}
a = x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < x_3 ... x_m = b
\end{equation*}

A function S $\in C^2[a,b]$\ms{C2 denotes first and second derivative} is called a cubic spline if S is a cubic polynomial $S_i$ in each interval $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$. It is a cubic interpolating spline if $s(x_i) = y_i$ for given values of $y_i$.

The ansatz of m piecewise polynomials is given by:
\begin{equation*}
s_i(x) = a_i (x-x_i) ^3 + b_i (x-x_i) ^2 + c_i (x-x_i) + di
\end{equation*}

For each $s_i$, we have 4 coefficients to be fixed $a_i, b_i, c_i$ and $d_i$.\\
so for m polynomials $(0 to m-1)$ , we need to fix $4m$ coefficients to fix the spline.\\

To fix these coefficients, we need 4m conditions \ms{similar to how we need 2 equations to solve for 2 variables}\\
The conditions are: 
\begin{equation}
S_i(x_i) = Y_i    ....   i = 0,1,2... m-1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S_{m-1} = Y_m
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S_i(x_{i+1}) = S_{i+1}(x_{i+1})   ..... i = 0,1,2... m-2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S_i ^{'}(x_{i+1}) = S^{'} _{i+1}(x_{i+1})   ..... i = 0,1,2... m-2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S_i ^{''}(x_{i+1}) = S^{''} _{i+1}(x_{i+1})   ..... i = 0,1,2... m-2
\end{equation}
\\
These are $4m-2$ conditions. We need 2 more for the spline to be unique which has several alternatives.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Natural splines $S^{''} _0(x_0) = 0$ and $S^{''}_{m-1}(x_m) = 0$
	\item End slope spline $S^{'} _0(x_0) = Y^{'}_0$ and $S^{'}_{m-1}(x_m) = Y^{'}_m$
	\item Periodic spline $S^{'} _0(x_0) = S^{'}_{m-1}(x_m)$ and $S^{''} _0(x_0) = S^{''}_{m-1}(x_m)$.
	\item Not-a-Knot spline $S^{'''} _0(x_1) = S^{'''} _1(x_1)$ and $S^{'''} _{m-2}(x_{m-1}) = S^{'''} _{m-1}(x_{m-1})$
\end{itemize}

\ms{If you want visually pleasing results, then choose Hermite cubic interpolation but if smoothness is important then cubic splines are better}








Interpolating the given data and requiring continuity of first derivative imposes $3n-4$ constraints on cubic spline.Requiring continuity at second derivative imposes n-2 additional constraints which leaves only 2 free parameters. The final two parameters can be fixed by floolowing ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{B-splines}


This allows the representation of arbitrary splines as a linear combination of basis functions. They can be defined in a number of ways like recursion, convolution and divided differences.\\
For given set of knots or data points $..t_{-2} < t_{-1} < t_0 < t_{1} < t_{2} < ...$\\

~\newline
\textbf{Assumptions for notational convinience:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We use recursion to define bsplines
	\item Assume infinite set of knots, even though in practice we have only finite set of knots
	\item Linear functions is assumed for notational convinience
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation*}
v_i ^k = \frac{t-t_i}{t_{i+k} - t_i}
\end{equation*}
To start the recursion we start with B-splines of degree 0 by:
\begin{equation*}
B_i ^0 (t) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if $t_i \leq t < t_{i+1}$}.\\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

For B-splines of degree k, $k > 0$,

\begin{equation*}
B_i ^k (t) = v_i ^k (t) B_i ^{k-1} (t) + (1 - v_{i+1} ^k (t))B_{i+1} ^{k-1} (t)
\end{equation*}
In general, $B_i ^k$ is a piecewise polynomial of degree $=$ k

\section{Least Squares}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only linear, no non linear.
\end{itemize}
The general form is given by,
\begin{equation*}
Ax \approxeq b
\end{equation*}

where the approximation is understood to be in 2-norm or least squares sense.

\subsection{Curve fitting}
\textbf{Given:}\\
m data points, $(t_i,y_i)$ where i $= 1,2,3 ... m$\\
\textbf{To find:}\\
Find n-vector x that it gives the best fit to th data by the model function f(t,x) \\
Best fit is defined by:\\
\begin{equation*}
\min_{x}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - f(t_i,x)) ^2
\end{equation*}
Assuming linear data, which means f is linear in parameter x, hence f is a linear combination of $\Phi_j$ that depend only on t.
\begin{equation*}
f(t,x) = x_1 \Phi_1(t) + x_2\Phi_2(t) + ... + x_n \Phi_n (t)
\end{equation*}
Where $\Phi_j$ can be replaced by $t^{j-1}$, so the equation becomes,
\begin{equation*}
f(t,x) = x1 + x2 t  + x_3 t^2 + ... + x_n t^{n-1}
\end{equation*}
The matrix form is given by,
\begin{equation*}
Ax \approxeq b
\end{equation*}
Where the entries of the matrix $a_{ij}$ is defined by $a_{ij} = \Phi_j(t_i)$ and m vector b is given by components $b_i = y_i$.

\textbf{Existence and uniqueness}
The solution to a $m X n$ least squares problem $Ax \approxeq b$
